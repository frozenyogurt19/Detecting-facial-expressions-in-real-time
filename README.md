# 🎭🎭 Detecting-facial-expressions-in-real-time :

This project is a  basic  real-time face expression detector using CNN model and OpenCV.
-It distingushed between 7 main emotion : Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral


📍Flow of work:
1. Webcam captures data
2. face is detected (using OpenCV)
3. CNN model makes predictions ( model trained on open src data : FER2013 )
4. Predicted emotion is displayed on web cam in resl-time!
